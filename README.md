<h1>Comparator Network API</h2>
<p>
    In this API, I am building out endpoints to support a project I have been working on a the University
of Iowa, Programming Language Concepts. The original project was to create CLI commands to run haskell functions. 
I have attached the original project pdf into this repo.

<h2>API Conversion</h2>
<p>I've decided to to create the same functionality but in an Node.js express app deployed to heroku.  I'm beginning to take a TDD approach to the development of each endpoint and the corresponding functions. The app's logic is simple, but it's main point is to show my comfortablility with Node.js testing and API creation.</p>
